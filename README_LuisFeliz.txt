Project 3 Objectives
	•	3 Subclasses, Each with their own conntainer for WordData Objects
		•	Array
		•	Circular Linked List
		•	STL *Insert type here* Object
	•	Make command Dump for argument call for all three
	•	Give option to pick which Subclass you want to use
		•	After User selects print method between the 3 options given 
			you will point TheList at an instatiated instance of that
			subclass, and retaining TheList->parseIntoList()
			you will populate the container from the chosen file.
		•	??????????


_________________________________Work On this Last___________________________________________
	•	If you somehow manage to complete this. have microsecond run to see
		how long it takes to run your program.
	•	app.cpp needs to be edited



NOTES:
	-	WordList.h is the print function taking all the words from all three subfunctions and outputting it
	-	WordData.cpp organizes the words given and puts them into the list in an ordered fashion
